				<h2>My Favorite place</h2>

				<p>Point Reyes comes to mind as my favorite place because of the personal nostalgia factor associated with it. My childhood Summer's often included a week or two of travel with family, up along the Pacific coast.

				Three of my favorite things about Point Reyes are:</p>

				<ul>
					<div class="half">
					<li>The scenic drive from San Francisco</li>
					<li>Slow-rolling fog over Tomales Bay.</li>
					<li>The unmistakeable stillness of the land, 
					and its distance from bustle</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Three Dishes</h2>

				<p>I picked three dishes at random to describe. First is a stir-fry. It's a dish made with a variety of vegetables, sacuces and meats, cooked in a Wok in hot oil. Second, a pizza consists of a wheat-based crust, sauce (typically tomato based), cheese and any variety of toppings. It is baked to create a supreme melted disc of cheese. And finally, sandwiches are any number of meats, cheeses, vegetables and sauces, held together by two pieces of bread (and gravity).</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>To conclude, the manner in which this Google Document has been created and shared among colleagues is a testament to current abilities with the Google Docs platform. Additionally, you might consider taking a trip to Point Reyes National Seashore. It's a magical place.
